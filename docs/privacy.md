# Dice Trek Adventures — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 6 October 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **Dice Trek Adventures** (the “**Service**” or the “**Bot**”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Discord application and related services.

**Operator.** The Service is operated by **RefresherTowel** (“**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”).
**Contact:** [refreshertowelgames@gmail.com](mailto:refreshertowelgames@gmail.com) • <https://refreshertowel.games>
**Governing Law:** Queensland, Australia

---

## 1) Scope

This policy covers information processed when you use the Bot in Discord servers or direct messages, interact with any companion websites, or support us via third-party platforms (e.g., Patreon). It should be read alongside Discord’s own terms and policies.

## 2) Information We Collect

We aim to collect the minimum information needed to run the game and keep the Service secure.

**Identifiers & basics (from Discord):**

- Discord user ID, username, display name, avatar, server (guild) IDs, channel IDs, and role IDs when relevant to gameplay.
- Message interaction metadata (e.g., command used, button clicked, timestamps). We **do not** store general message content; we only process command/interaction content needed for game features or moderation/audit logs.

**Gameplay data:**

- Progression, inventories, stats, leaderboards, cooldowns, duel/PvE states, and other records necessary to provide game features.

**Server configuration data:**

- Feature toggles, permissions, economy settings, and IDs needed to operate the Bot in a server.

**Payments & perks (optional):**

- If you support us via Patreon or other platforms, we may receive your Discord ID and entitlement status to enable perks. We do **not** receive your full payment details; those are handled by the payment provider. We may store purchase records necessary for entitlement and anti-abuse.

**Logs & diagnostics:**

- System logs (timestamps, request IDs, error traces), limited IP and user‑agent data _from our websites only_ (not from Discord chats), and security signals used to detect abuse and ensure service reliability.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive categories of data. Please do not submit sensitive information to the Service.

## 3) How We Use Information

- **Provide and improve the game.** Run commands, save progress, balance features, fix bugs, and develop new modes.
- **Safety and moderation.** Prevent spam/abuse, detect exploits, enforce limits, and comply with legal obligations.
- **Entitlements.** Verify and deliver perks for supporters (e.g., via Patreon).
- **Analytics.** Measure feature usage (aggregate/de‑identified where possible) to understand what players enjoy.
- **Communications.** Respond to support requests and announce important changes.

## 4) Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)

Where applicable law requires a legal basis, we rely on:

- **Contract** (to provide the Service you request);
- **Legitimate interests** (to secure, debug, and improve the Service; to prevent abuse);
- **Consent** (where required, e.g., certain optional notifications);
- **Legal obligation** (to comply with law or valid requests).

## 5) Sharing of Information

We share information only as needed to operate the Service:

- **Discord** (platform provider): interactions necessary for the Bot to function.
- **Hosting & infrastructure providers** (e.g., cloud, database, monitoring): to run the Service.
- **Payment/creator platforms** (e.g., Patreon) for entitlement checks.
- **Analytics/anti‑abuse tools** (if used) for safety and reliability.
- **Legal & compliance**: to comply with law, defend legal claims, or protect rights, users, or the Service.
  We do **not** sell user data. We do not share data for cross‑context behavioral advertising.

## 6) International Data Transfers

Our providers may process data in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) and ensure providers meet comparable security standards.

## 7) Data Retention

- **Gameplay records:** kept while your account is active in the Service and for a reasonable period thereafter (e.g., 12–24 months of inactivity) unless you request deletion sooner.
- **Server configuration:** retained while the Bot is in the server; removed when the Bot is removed or after prolonged inactivity.
- **Logs/diagnostics:** typically 30–180 days unless needed for security, debugging, or legal reasons.
- **Backups:** limited‑lifecycle backups may persist for up to 90 days after primary deletion.

## 8) Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards (principle of least privilege, access controls, audit logs, and encryption in transit; encryption at rest where supported). No system is 100% secure; your use is at your own risk.

## 9) Your Rights & Choices

**All users:** You can remove the Bot from a server at any time. You may ask us to access, correct, or delete your gameplay data (subject to limits). We may need your **Discord user ID** and the **server (guild) ID** to locate records.

**Australia:** You may request access and correction under the Australian Privacy Act. If unresolved, you may complain to the **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)**.

**EEA/UK:** Subject to law, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object, or request portability of your personal data. You may also complain to your local supervisory authority.

**California:** We do not sell or share personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising. Subject to the CCPA/CPRA, California residents may request access or deletion of personal information we hold.

To exercise any rights, contact us at **[refreshertowelgames@gmail.com](mailto:refreshertowelgames@gmail.com)** with your Discord user ID and server ID.

## 10) Children’s Privacy

The Service is intended for users **13+** and follows Discord’s age requirements. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or under the minimum age of digital consent in your region). If you believe a child has provided us information, contact us so we can delete it.

## 11) Automated Decision‑Making

We do not engage in automated decision‑making that produces legal or similarly significant effects about you.

## 12) Changes to this Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date above. Material changes will be reasonably notified (for example, via release notes or within the support server).
