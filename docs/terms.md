- We may update, suspend, or discontinue any feature at any time, with or without notice, including for maintenance or to address abuse.

## 3) Virtual Items, Currency & Upgrades

- **Refunds.** Except where required by law, all purchases are **final and non-refundable** once the benefit has begun (e.g., perks enabled). For Patreon, please refer also to Patreon’s own terms and policies.
- **Chargebacks.** If a chargeback occurs, we may revoke associated Virtual Items or perks and may restrict your access to the Service.

## 5) Server Owners & Moderators

- If you enable or invite the Bot to a server, you represent that you have the necessary permissions.
- Server owners and moderators are responsible for enforcing Discord rules within their communities. We may respond to abuse reports and, at our discretion, restrict the Bot in particular servers or to particular users.

- Violate Discord’s Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

- Attempt to cheat, exploit bugs, automate gameplay in a disruptive way, reverse engineer, or overload/rate-limit the Service.

We may take enforcement action (warnings, content removal, rollbacks, suspensions, bans, or resets of progress) at our discretion to protect the Service and its users.

## 7) User Content & License

- “**User Content**” includes messages, usernames, images, and other material you share while using the Service.

## 9) Intellectual Property

- We (and our licensors) own the Service, including all software, artwork, designs, and content we provide.

## 10) Third-Party Services

- The Service relies on Discord and may interact with other third-party platforms. Their terms and privacy policies apply in addition to these Terms.
- We are **not affiliated with Discord** and make no warranties on behalf of Discord or any third party.

## 11) Changes to the Service or Terms

- We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date will change when we do.
- Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

## 12) Termination

- You may stop using the Service at any time by removing the Bot from your server or ceasing interaction.
- We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for any reason, including breach of these Terms or risk to the Service.
- Upon termination, licenses granted to you under these Terms end immediately, and you may lose access to Virtual Items and progress.

## 13) Disclaimers

- **The Service is provided “AS IS”** and “AS AVAILABLE.” We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
- We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation, or that exploits will not occur.

## 14) Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

- Our total liability for any claim relating to the Service shall not exceed the greater of **AUD $50** or the amounts you paid to us for the Service in the **previous three (3) months**.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in those cases, those limits apply only to the extent permitted by law.

## 15) Indemnification

## 17) Severability; Waiver

If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.
